# Corner Grocer

Analyzing the text records generated by Corner Grocer throughout the day allows users to find the frequency of a given item and print a histogram that represents the frequency of each item.

* What did you do particularly well?

I developed and designed the project from the given requirements.

* Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I would support multiple file formats and provide more graphical representations and sorting options.

* Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part was translating the requirements into workable software. I broke the requirements into smaller pieces and worked on each part separately. 

* What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The most valuable skill I developed during the course was project design and documentation.

* How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I broke the project into smaller pieces and develop separate class to handle single issue (Single Responsibility)
